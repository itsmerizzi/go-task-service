# go-task-service
Task microservice built in Golang that receives calls through an API

I've recently been studying golang, so this is just the beginning.

In this repository I made a task microservice 

We have two simple endpoints, one for creating tasks and another for listing the tasks.

I implemented the concept of channels and go routines that allows the developer to work with multi threading in a very simple way.

Again, this is something very simple, I plan on doing something more elaborate in the near future
